# discord-bot
======================================================================================
INTRODUCTION TO REPOSITORY
  This repository is for all discord.js functions. 
  Language used is JavaScript.
  Please drop all your codes that may be useful for bot programming.
  
  Some simple rules to follow:
- branch name to be significant to code
- every edit is to be done on a new branch, then to be requested to be pulled
- make sure that your code runs smoothly with minimal error when added to main branch
- keep this repository clean (do not create unecessary branches)
- make sure that every commit message is meaningful
- comment on what each part of a code does after the function

  More rules may be added in the future
  
  Contribution is greatly appreciated as I am at a beginner level coding in terms of JavaScript.
